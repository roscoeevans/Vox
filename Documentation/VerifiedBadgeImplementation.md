# Verified Badge Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a Twitter-like verified badge system for Bluesky handles in the Vox app. This feature provides visual verification for accounts using custom domains while keeping the UI clean by filtering out common domain suffixes.

## Components Created

### 1. **AuthorHandleView** (`Features/Feed/Views/Components/AuthorHandleView.swift`)
A reusable SwiftUI component that displays:
- Formatted handle (with common domains filtered out)
- Blue checkmark badge for verified accounts
- Popover showing full handle when badge is tapped

Key features:
- Supports both regular and compact display modes
- Uses SF Symbol `checkmark.seal.fill` for the verified badge
- Popover includes verification explanation

### 2. **Updated Handle Formatting**
- `HandleFormatter.swift`: Now always hides common TLDs (.com, .co, etc.)
- `BSAuthor.swift`: Updated `isVerified` property to correctly identify custom domains

## How It Works

### Domain Filtering
```swift
// Common domains that are always hidden:
.com, .co, .net, .org, .io, .dev, .app, .social, .xyz, .me
.bsky.social, .bsky.team, .bsky.app, .bsky.network

// Examples:
alice.com → @alice (no badge)
bob.bsky.social → @bob (no badge)
news.nytimes.com → @news.nytimes.com ✓ (with badge)
senator.senate.gov → @senator.senate.gov ✓ (with badge)
```

### Verification Logic
An account is considered verified if:
1. The formatted handle equals the original handle (no suffix was removed)
2. The handle contains a dot (has a domain)

This means truly custom domains like organizational domains are preserved and marked as verified.

## UI Integration

### PostView
```swift
// Before:
Text("@" + post.author.formattedHandle)

// After:
AuthorHandleView(author: post.author)
```

### QuotedPostView
```swift
// For compact display in quoted posts:
AuthorHandleView(author: post.author, isCompact: true)
```

## User Experience

1. **Clean UI**: Common domains are hidden, reducing visual clutter
2. **Visual Verification**: Blue checkmark indicates custom domain accounts
3. **Full Handle Access**: Tapping the checkmark shows the complete handle
4. **Familiar Pattern**: Similar to Twitter's verification system

## Example Display

| Full Handle | Display | Verified |
|------------|---------|----------|
| alice.bsky.social | @alice | No |
| bob.com | @bob | No |
| news.nytimes.com | @news.nytimes.com ✓ | Yes |
| senator.senate.gov | @senator.senate.gov ✓ | Yes |

## Future Enhancements

1. **Actual Verification**: Integrate with AT Protocol's domain verification
2. **Custom Badge Colors**: Different colors for different verification types
3. **Badge Tooltips**: Show verification date or type
4. **Settings**: User preferences for badge display
