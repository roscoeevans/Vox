**Vox: MVP Specification Document**

---

## üåü Overview

**Vox** is a beautifully minimalist, conversation-first social app built on the [BlueSky AT Protocol](https://atproto.com). Think of it as the Apple-designed Twitter alternative: elegant, intentional, and expressive without the noise. Threads (posts) are the heart of Vox, with curated features that promote meaningful interaction and curated expression. Vox prioritizes **discoverability** as a core pillar‚Äîhelping users find content that resonates, and helping creators find an audience.

## üåé Design Philosophy

* **Minimalism with soul**: Clean typography, spacious UI, elegant interactions.
* **Intentionality over virality**: Users post thoughtfully and discover with purpose.
* **Creative self-expression**: Support for multiple tones, moods, and post types.
* **Respectful engagement**: Limited metrics, smart defaults, no algorithmic trickery.
* **Frictionless discovery**: Feeds, recommendations, and tags designed to surface timely and personalized content.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Core Technologies

* **Frontend**: iOS (SwiftUI)
* **Backend**: BlueSky AT Protocol for identity, data, feeds
* **Custom Services**: Node.js or Swift-based microservices for private features (e.g., Circle, Discover Feed)
* **Architecture**: Monolithic for MVP

  * A monolithic architecture is preferred for the MVP due to its simplicity, speed of development, and reduced infrastructure complexity.
  * It allows for rapid iteration and tightly integrated feature development.
  * As the app scales and usage patterns emerge, components such as the feed engine or Circle mechanics can be modularized into separate services if needed.
