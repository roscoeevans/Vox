# Generated Code Organization

## Scope
This rule defines where and how to organize auto-generated code (such as protocol models from codegen tools) in the Vox project, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and architectural consistency.

## Rule
- Place all auto-generated code in a top-level directory named `Generated/` (or `GeneratedSwift/` if language-specific).
- Do **not** mix generated files with hand-written code in `Models/`, `Core/`, or `Features/`.
- Add the `Generated/` directory to Xcode as a folder reference, not a group, to ensure new files are picked up automatically.
- Never hand-edit files in `Generated/`. If customization is needed, wrap or extend generated types in your own modules.
- Optionally, add `Generated/` to `.gitignore` if you prefer not to commit generated code; otherwise, keep it tracked for reproducibility.
- Document the codegen process in `Docs/` or the project README.

## Example
```
/Generated/         # All generated Swift files (e.g., from atproto-lexicon-gen)
/Core/
/Models/
/Features/
```

## Rationale
Keeping generated code separate from hand-written code prevents accidental edits, clarifies code ownership, and aligns with Vox's modular, maintainable architecture.
