# Animation and Interaction Guidelines

## Overview
This rule defines how animations and interactions should be implemented in Vox, ensuring a fluid, responsive, and Apple-like feel throughout the app.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Animation Principles
- Every animation must serve a purpose
- Keep animations subtle and natural
- Use spring animations for interactive elements
- Respect "Reduce Motion" setting

### 2. Standard Durations
```swift
extension Animation {
    static let voxStandard = Animation.easeInOut(duration: 0.3)
    static let voxSpring = Animation.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.7)
    static let voxQuick = Animation.easeInOut(duration: 0.15)
}
```

### 3. Common Animations
- Navigation transitions: Push/pop with standard duration
- Modal presentations: Slide up with spring animation
- Button feedback: Quick scale with spring
- List updates: Fade with standard duration
- Loading states: Subtle pulse animation

### 4. Implementation
```swift
// Button animation
struct AnimatedButton: View {
    @State private var isPressed = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Action") {
            withAnimation(.voxSpring) {
                isPressed = true
            }
            // Action
        }
        .scaleEffect(isPressed ? 0.95 : 1.0)
        .animation(.voxSpring, value: isPressed)
    }
}

// List animation
struct AnimatedList: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(items) { item in
                ItemRow(item: item)
                    .transition(.opacity)
            }
        }
        .animation(.voxStandard, value: items)
    }
}
```

### 5. Gesture Interactions
- Support standard iOS gestures
- Provide immediate visual feedback
- Allow gesture interruption
- Use spring animations for gesture completion

### 6. Haptic Feedback
- Use system haptics for standard actions
- Provide feedback for important events
- Keep haptics subtle and purposeful
- Test on real devices

### 7. Performance
- Avoid expensive animations
- Use hardware-accelerated properties
- Test on older devices
- Monitor animation frame rates

### 8. Accessibility
- Respect "Reduce Motion" setting
- Provide alternative feedback methods
- Ensure animations don't interfere with VoiceOver
- Test with accessibility features enabled

## Rationale
Following Apple's animation and interaction guidelines ensures Vox feels responsive and natural. Proper animations provide feedback and context while maintaining performance and accessibility.
